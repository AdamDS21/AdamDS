<center><h1>The Tenor Pan </h1><center>

<p>The main function of the tenor pan is to play a melody. (They carry the 'tune'). They are the highest pitched instruments in the steel pan family and have a nice, bright, shrill tone.This category of steel pan has a wide range of pans such as :High Tenor

The high tenor (also known as a soprano pan) is the highest pitched of the steel drums (steel pans) with a pitch range of D4 to F#6, that is, up to two octaves and a major third from D above middle C (C4). Its predecessor actually contained fewer notes which were within the tenor range. However, the name "Tenor" was kept despite the higher range of its descendant, the soprano pan. The notes of this pan is arranged in the cycle of 4ths, going clockwise.Low Tenor
The Low Tenor, which has a pitch range from C4 to E6 has notes that are arranged in the same order as the high tenor. The function of this steel pan is the same as that of the high tenor and it is also used by pan soloists.The Double Tenor, which was invented by Bertie Marshall, uses 2 drums and has a pitch range from F3 to B5 or up to two octaves and an augmented 4th from F below middle C. These steel pans have a distinctively pleasant sound, which makes them very appealing to pan soloists. The double tenor can be used to carry the melody, a harmonic voice, for counter melodies or for chords.</p>
